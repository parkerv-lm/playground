The Pita Jungle idea was born: it took off like a brush fire with locations scorching the Arizona landscape and more recently spreading to California's. Pita Jungle espouses the Mediterranean diet principles by providing through its new American cuisine menu a fine balance of low fat meats, seafood, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, olive oil and fruits. It remains ever faithful to its slogan, The Art of Eating Healthy. Pita Jungle is artsy and subtlety hip. Every location looks different in design and is adorned by local art/paintings on rotation. The music extending from fusion Jazz to Indy rock, classical to Cuban, engenders an upbeat mood, where expeditious service covers tables with myriads of Tapas, taboule, hummus, baba ganoosh, paired with boutique wines, local beers and spirits, Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour. Pita Jungle's commitment to responsible and healthy living goes beyond the food they serve on their table. Pita Jungle is actively involved in projects that favor our environment, from sponsorship of research and development projects pertaining to the resolution of macro environmental problems, down to the store level, where they phased out styro-foam containers, along with their participation in the save a straw program that seeks to reduce the disposal of a hard to recycle item. Also and perhaps more significantly, through the purchase of carbon credits, Pita Jungle offsets all of their operation related carbon emissions: Pita Jungle is carbon neutral.",,"[{""key"":""Other Information:"",""value"":""Parking: Garage, Street, On SiteWi-Fi: NoBike Parking: YesAttire: CasualWheelchair Accessible: NoCuisines: Mediterranean, Greek, EuropeanAlcohol: Beer, Full Bar, WineTakes Reservations: NoOutdoor Seating: YesPrice Range : Average""}]","[{""day"":""Mon - Thu"",""hour"":""11:00 am - 10:00 pm""},{""day"":""Fri - Sat"",""hour"":""11:00 am - 11:00 am""},{""day"":""Sun"",""hour"":""11:00 am - 9:00 pm""}]",,,us/ca/pasadena/43ecoloradoblvd/-347470378,34.14578,,-118.14954,,,Pita Jungle (pasadena),"amex, discover, master card, visa",6264327482,91105,,CA,,,http://www.pitajungle.com/catering
